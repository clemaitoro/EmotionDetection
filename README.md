# EmotionDetection
Small object detection into emotion recognition model trained with Yolov7 and tensorflow
The emotion detection is trained ond the FER-2013 dataset while the face recognition dataset is made by me by gathering lots of images from different places
I used this notebook found on kaggle to help me optimize my Tensorflow model https://www.kaggle.com/code/ammfat/facial-emotion-recognition-vgg16-fer2013
